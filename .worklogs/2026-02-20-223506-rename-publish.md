# Rename to @tartakovsky/depgraph and publish

**Date:** 2026-02-20 22:35
**Scope:** package.json, README.md

## Summary
Renamed npm package from `depgraph-cli` to `@tartakovsky/depgraph` and published v0.1.0 to npm.

## Context & Problem
npm rejected `depgraph-cli` as too similar to existing `dep-graph-cli`. Scoped package `@tartakovsky/depgraph` works.

## Decisions Made
- **Chose:** `@tartakovsky/depgraph` over other names
- **Why:** Clean, matches GitHub repo owner, no conflicts

## Key Files for Context
- `package.json` — package name
- `README.md` — install instructions
