# Add Go language support

**Date:** 2026-02-20 22:46
**Scope:** src/languages/go.ts, src/tests/go.test.ts, src/parse.ts, src/parser-loader.ts, package.json, README.md

## Summary
Added Go extractor — structs map to "class" nodes, interfaces to "interface" nodes. Struct embedding and interface embedding produce "extends" edges. 12 new tests, 60 total passing.

## Decisions Made

### Go struct → "class" kind
- **Chose:** Map Go structs to "class" kind
- **Why:** Go structs serve the same architectural role. Adding a new kind would complicate consumers for no benefit.

### Struct embedding as "extends"
- **Chose:** `type Dog struct { Animal }` → Dog extends Animal
- **Why:** Embedding is Go's composition/inheritance mechanism

### Builtin type filtering
- **Chose:** Hardcoded set of Go builtins (string, int, bool, error, etc.) filtered from edges
- **Why:** Edges to builtins add noise. Same approach as the existing filterAndDedupe for external types, but needed at parse time for Go since builtins aren't imported.

### Dynamic import for tree-sitter
- **Chose:** Use variable-based import (`const pkg = "tree-sitter"; import(pkg)`) instead of string literal
- **Why:** TypeScript resolves `import("tree-sitter")` at compile time and fails if the package isn't installed (it's optional). Using a variable makes it opaque to the TS compiler.

## Key Files for Context
- `src/languages/go.ts` — Go extractor
- `src/tests/go.test.ts` — 12 Go tests
- `src/parser-loader.ts` — dynamic import fix for optional native tree-sitter
