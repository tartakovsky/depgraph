# Improve README with output examples

**Date:** 2026-02-20 22:25
**Scope:** README.md

## Summary
Rewrote README with real output examples, motivation section, edge/node type tables, and hook integration example.

## Context & Problem
Original README was minimal — just listed commands without showing what the tool actually produces or why you'd use it.

## Decisions Made

### README structure
- **Chose:** Why → Install → Usage (with output examples) → Reference tables → Requirements
- **Why:** Lead with motivation, show output early so readers immediately understand what it does

### Output examples
- **Chose:** Real output from scanning depgraph's own codebase, plus a realistic diff example
- **Why:** Authentic examples are more convincing than contrived ones

## Key Files for Context
- `~/Projects/depgraph/README.md` — the updated file
